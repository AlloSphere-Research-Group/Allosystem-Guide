# Writing applications using AlloSystem

This tutorial will focus on using the AlloSystem command line building facilities using the *run.sh* script. The code should work unchanged if you use AlloProject or your own IDE project, but the building procedure might differ to the instructions below.

##The "Steps"

Matt Wright's and Karl Yerkes' "Steps" are a series of C++ programs starting from "Hello, World!" and incrementally growing to an interactive (well, at least navigable) world of colored spheres each moving up and down to show the current pitch of the algorithmically generated sinewave "song" it is looping.  The diff from each to the next is always reasonably small and comprehendable, as we recommend in general as a best practice for incremental development and check-in of AlloSystem programs.

### Hello, World!

An AlloSystem program must start as any other C++ program with a main function:

    #include <iostream>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
      return 0;
    }

If you save this text to a file called *allotutorial.cpp* in the *projects/* directory of AlloSystem, you can run it by typing on the shell (from the root AlloSystem source directory):

    ./run.sh projects/allotutorial.cpp

### Hello, World! in constructor of al::App

To make an "AlloApp", you need to write a class that inherits from the AlloSystem *App* class. This class is defined in the header *allocore/io/al_App.hpp*. We will use a *struct* instead of a class, to simplify inheritance and make all members public (i.e. no need to worry about what is public, private or protected). Note that this is not usually good practice as it breaks the encapsulation paradigm of object oriented programming, but it makes it easier to code simple applications.

    #include <iostream>
    #include <allocore/io/al_App.hpp>

    struct AlloApp: al::App {
      AlloApp() {
        std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
      }

    };

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
      MyApp app;
      return 0;
    }

Remember that you need to prefix the namespace *al* to all AlloSystem classes. An alternative is to bring the *al* namespace into the global namespace, which saves the need to prefix the class:

    #include "allocore/io/al_App.hpp" // gets us App
    using namespace al;
    using namespace std;

    struct AlloApp : App {
        AlloApp() {
            cout << "Created AlloApp" << endl;
        }
    };

    int main() {
        AlloApp app;
        return 0;
    }

Notice that in the last example we didn't use the arguments:

    (int argc, char* argv[])

in the main function. Command line arguments or flags are passed to your application through these variables. Command line arguments are used to adjust the way an application runs, for example, you can pass a filename, the resolution of your application, or any other type of global or initial configuration. If you don't need to use command line arguments in your application, you can leave these out.

### Open a window

AlloSystem "Apps" provide the facility to create windows. You can call the *initWindow()* function of the *app* object to initialize a window, and then the *start()* function to start the GUI processing loop, which will keep the program running until the window is closed.

    #include "allocore/io/al_App.hpp"
    using namespace al;
    struct AlloApp : App {
      AlloApp() {
        std::cout << "Created AlloApp" << std::endl;
        initWindow();
      }
    };
    int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
      AlloApp app;
      app.start();
      return 0;
    }

### Make a sphere mesh and draw it in the window

To draw items on the screen, you must reimplement the *onDraw()* virtual function. Reimplementing a function means making a function in a child class (or struct) that replaces an exisitng one in the parent. What "virtual" means is that when the parent al::App class needs to draw items on the screen, it will call the function that you have defined, instead of its own original *onDraw()* function.

There is a default interface to the graphics rendering created with the parent *App*. It is called *g*, and you can draw a mesh in it by passing a *Mesh* object to its *draw()* function.

First, add a Mesh object called *m* to the *AlloApp* struct:

    struct AlloApp : App {
      Mesh m;

Then within we will reimplement *onDraw()* like this:

      virtual void onDraw(Graphics& g, const Viewpoint& v) {
        g.draw(m);
      }
    };

Notice that the types for *g* and *v* have a *&* character at the end. This means they are passed *by reference*. When a variable is passed by reference, it is not copied before entering the new function, but it is the same actual values in memory that are passed, so any changes you make to the variable will affect the variable in the calller functions. This is similar to the use of pointers in C, but the difference is that you use the variable as a regular object rather than having to *dereference* the pointer.

Also notice that since the *m* Mesh is a member of the struct, we don't need to pass it as an argument. It is available to all the member functions of the struct.

An *AlloApp* has keyboard and mouse navigation active by default. Drag the mouse or use the arrow keys to look in a different direction. You can move the "camera" with the W, A, D and X keys. You can rotate the camera around its axis with Q and Z and if you want to move this rotation axis you can use E and C. The *Esc* key will toggle fullscreen and Ctrl+Q will quit the application.

If you navigate the scene, you will notice that we start in the center of the sphere!

###Use the OpenGL TRIANGLES primitive to make it look solid

In the *AlloApp* constructor, you can specify the type of primitives that the mesh will be rendered with:

    struct AlloApp : App {
      Mesh m;
      AlloApp() {
        std::cout << "Created AlloApp" << std::endl;
        addSphere(m);
        m.primitive(Graphics::TRIANGLES);
        initWindow();
      }

      ...

    };

Now the sphere will be rendered using triangles, rather than points. Since we are in the middle of the sphere, you will see white no matter where you look!

###Initialize camera position to outside the sphere

To set the initial camera position, we need to call the *pos()* function to the *nav()* function.

    struct AlloApp : App {
      Mesh m;
      AlloApp() {
        nav().pos(0, 0, 10);

        addSphere(ourMesh);
        m.primitive(Graphics::TRIANGLES);
        initWindow();
      }
     ...
    };

The *pos()* function takes x, y and z coordinates. You can see that we set the z to 10, which moved the camera towards you 10 units. So the z axis is by default the depth of the scene.

###Try positioning a light too

You might have noticed that the sphere doesn't really look three-dimensional. This is because there are no lights in the scene reflecting from the sphere, to make it have volume.

To add a light to a scene, you first need to add it as a member to the struct, just like the mesh:

    struct AlloApp : App {
      Light light;
      Mesh m;

Then, you need to position the light in the scene:

      AlloApp() {
        nav().pos(0, 0, 10);
        light.pos(0, 0, 10);

Finally, you need to make sure the light is drawn every frame by calling the Light object as if it was a function:

      virtual void onDraw(Graphics& g, const Viewpoint& v) {
        light();
        g.draw(m);
      }
    };

But wait! It still doesn't look right.

###You also have to compute normals to get lighting effects

To make sure the light in a scene does what it should, you need to generate the normals to the mesh, that way, light will know how it "reflects" off of each triangle.

      AlloApp() {
        nav().pos(0, 0, 10);
        light.pos(0, 0, 10);
        addSphere(m);
        m.primitive(Graphics::TRIANGLES);
        m.generateNormals();
        initWindow();


VoilÃ ! Now the sphere appears to have volume.

###Raw sound: impulse train at the audio block rate

// - show doxygen on initAudio, onSound,
// - introduce the generator pattern: io() and AudioIOData
// - explain the waveform (pulse) and pitch of the sound
// - show adjusting audio buffer size with initAudio
//

The first thing you need to do if you want audio in your application, is call the *initAudio()* function of AlloApp within the contructor:

    struct AlloApp : App {
      Light light;
      Mesh m;
      AlloApp() {

        ...

        initWindow(Window::Dim(200,300), "Title", 10);
        initAudio();
      }
      ...

Then you need to define what audio will go out. This is done by reimplementing the *onSound()* function:

      virtual void onSound(AudioIOData& io) {
        // this will make a pulse wave with a frequency of 44100 / 128 Hz
        io();
        io.out(0) = io.out(1) = 1.0f; // left = right = 1.0f;
        while (io()) {
          io.out(0) = io.out(1) = 0.0f;
        }
      }
    };

Notice that this function takes a reference to an *AudioIOData* object. This object holds the input and output buffers as well as other useful information about the audio process. You can access the buffers for each channel by passing an index to the *out()* and *in()* functions of the *AudioIOData* object.

###Interactive sound

To create interactive applications, you want to bring in control data, from an input device, like the keyboard, the mouse, a MIDI device, etc. and send it to the audio processing function. To share the information, the simplest way is to create a class variable that will pass the information between these two separate processes.

    struct AlloApp : App {
      bool shouldClick;
      Light light;
      Mesh m;

      AlloApp() {
        ...
        shouldClick = true;
      }

Whenever a key is pressed, the AlloSystem App will call its virtual function *onKeyDown()*, so if you want to process keyboard events yourself, all you have to do is reimplement the function. In this case, we will check whether a spacebar has been pressed and we set the member variable *shouldClick* to true.

      virtual void onKeyDown(const ViewpointWindow& vw, const Keyboard& k) {
        if (k.key() == ' ') {
          std::cout << "Spacebar pressed" << std::endl;
          shouldClick = true;
        }
      }

Then we create a function that produces a single click whenever the spacebar has been pressed:

      virtual void onSound(AudioIOData& io) {
        while ( io() ) {
          if (shouldClick) {
            shouldClick = false;
            float s = 1.0f;
            io.out(0) = s;
            io.out(1) = s;
          }
          else {
            float s = 0.0f;
            io.out(0) = s;
            io.out(1) = s;
          }
        }
      }

###Drawing more spheres

You can use a single mesh to draw multiple times on a Graphics object. To be useful you can perform a translation prior to drawing. This will draw two separate spheres:

      virtual void onDraw(Graphics& g, const Viewpoint& v) {
        light();
        g.draw(m);

        g.translate(2, 1, 0);
        g.draw(m);
      }


You can quickly draw a large number of objects by doing this within a loop:

    struct AlloApp : App {
      Light light;
      Mesh m;
      Vec3f position[N];

      AlloApp() {
        ...
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
          position[i] = Vec3f(sin(i), i, -i * i);
        }
        ...
      }

      virtual void onDraw(Graphics& g, const Viewpoint& v) {
        light();

        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
          g.pushMatrix();
          g.translate(position[i]);
          g.draw(m);
          g.popMatrix();
        }
      }

###Animate sphere positions with random walk

// - explain why we use onAnimate() rather than onDraw()
// - mention Vec += operator
//

    #include "allocore/io/al_App.hpp"
    #include "Gamma/Oscillator.h"
    using namespace al;
    #define N 20
    struct AlloApp : App {
      Light light;
      Mesh m;
      gam::Sine<> sine[N];
      Vec3f position[N];
      AlloApp() {
        std::cout << "Created AlloApp" << std::endl;
        nav().pos(0, 0, 10);
        light.pos(0, 0, 10);
        addSphere(m);
        m.primitive(Graphics::TRIANGLES);
        m.scale(0.2);
        m.generateNormals();
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
          sine[i].freq(220.0 + i * i);
          position[i] = Vec3f(sin(i), i, -i * i / 7);
        }
        initWindow();
        initAudio();
      }
      virtual void onAnimate(double dt) {
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
          position[i] += Vec3f(rnd::uniformS(), rnd::uniformS(), rnd::uniformS()) * 0.01;
      }
      virtual void onDraw(Graphics& g, const Viewpoint& v) {
        light();
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
          g.pushMatrix();
          g.translate(position[i]);
          g.draw(m);
          g.popMatrix();
        }
      }
      virtual void onSound(AudioIOData& io) {
        gam::Sync::master().spu(audioIO().fps());
        while (io()) {
          float s = 0;
          for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
            s += sine[i]();
          io.out(0) = io.out(1) = s / N;
        }
      }
      virtual void onKeyDown(const ViewpointWindow&, const Keyboard& k) {
        if (k.key() == ' ') {
          std::cout << "Spacebar pressed" << std::endl;
        }
      }
    };
    int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
      AlloApp app;
      app.start();
      return 0;
    }


##AlloSystem Examples
